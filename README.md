# LIV for Outer Wilds

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3955124/164702625-6eea1f07-e072-43e3-be0a-6c92264db681.png)

Adds [LIV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) support to Outer Wilds with NomaiVR. With it, you can use mixed reality capture (video where you have your real body inserted into the game), avatars (custom 3D avatars with a dynamic camera that can be in third person, while you play the game normally in first person), smoothed first person view, and more.

## Instructions

This isn't super straightforward so please read these instructions before using the mod.

### First start

The first time you start the game with the LIV mod installed, you need to start via the Mod Manager "Start Game" button. In the "Manual" tab, select the Outer Wilds exe and check if everyrhing is working properly.

### After first start

After you started the game with LIV once and everything was working, you can start the game directly from LIV. The game should now show in the game seleciton dropdown, in the "Auto" tab.

### While playing

If something looks wrong, Hold "Thrust Up" and press the "Cancel" button to reset the LIV camera. Check the SteamVR input bindings if you wanna know what buttons are assigned to those actions.

### Performance

[NomaiVR](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/nomaivr/) by itself is already suuper heavy (due to Outer Wilds not being optimized for VR). Add LIV on top of that, and you get a nice slideshow. I recommend keeping LIV at 30 FPS and low resolution. Plus, reduce the SteamVR rendering resolution, and all graphics settings set to minimum. There's also a [Fixed Foveated Rendering](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/nomaivrffr/) mod for RTX cards that can help a lot.
