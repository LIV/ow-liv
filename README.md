Adds [LIV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) support to Outer Wilds with NomaiVR. With it, you can use mixed reality capture (video where you have your real body inserted into the game), avatars (custom 3D avatars with a dynamic camera that can be in third person, while you play the game normally in first person), smoothed first person view, and more.

Hold "Thrust Up" and press the "Cancel" button to reset the LIV camera.
