Adds [LIV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755540/LIV/) support to Outer Wilds with NomaiVR. With it, you can use mixed reality capture (video where you have your real body inserted into the game), avatars (custom 3D avatars with a dynamic camera that can be in third person, while you play the game normally in first person), smoothed first person view, and more.

## Instructions

### First start

The first time you start the game with the LIV mod installed, you need to start via the Mod Manager "Start Game" button. In the "Manual" tab, select the Outer Wilds exe and check if everyrhing is working properly.

### After first start

After you started the game with LIV once and everything was working, you can start the game directly from LIV. The game should now show in the game seleciton dropdown, in the "Auto" tab.
